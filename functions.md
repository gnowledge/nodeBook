# Functions

In nodeBook we interpret functions as **derived attributes**. They will be
included in the data exactly as attributes, except that the values
will be computed.

For example: Oxygen's atomic number is same as the number of
protons. We add the attribute number of protons as a regular
attribute, however for atomic number we use a function that says how
to compute it. in this simple case, it is same as the number of
protons. However this special attribute, will work for all the
elements.

Another example: Oxygen's atomic mass can be computed by adding the
number of neutrons and protons.

A Physics example: Given the position data and time of a car, we can
compute the distance travelled, displacement, speed, velocity,
acceleration etc.  if we know the mass, then we can also compute
force.

This is how functions are interpretted, and we expect the students to
learn the meaning of what they are from this approach. In this way
they will also know why scientists use equations, which are nothing
but derived attributes.
