# MindMap mode
The first feature is to enable MindMap mode, where the CNL will not have attributes, relations and functions markup. A simple section, subjection and sub-subsectin will be enabled, mentioning what is the interpretation of the relation between section and subjection is: e.g. <has part>, <contains>, <includes>, <provides> or <subtype>, <subgroup>, <subclass> etc.  All of them have to be transitive relations (mereology). Only the root section mentions the name of the transitive relation.  When submitted, we get a mindmap with or without label to the relations between them.  

Use case:  Introducing the relevance of graph theory to novices is often found to be easy with familiar relations like part-whole, containement, And the regular document model of nested containers is well known to them. So, bringing them to furher sophhisticated /advanced relations, attributes and functions supported by nodeBook with transitions becomes easy over a period of time. This mode will help them understand the  structure that supports  inference, 

Markdown Parsing: While creating a graph document, the user will be prompted with a question: mondmap or richgraph mode. Then we create the following CNL:

<! MindMap Mode: contains>
```graph-description
Descrition of the graph document.  Optionally 
```
# Cell
```description
Cell is a structural and functional unit of all living organisms.
```
## Nucleus
```description
Nucleus is a transient structure of every cell holding the genetic material, which disappears during the cell division and reappears after.
```
### Chromosomes
#### DNA
### Nucleolus
## Cytoplasm
### Ribosomes
### Endoplasmic Reticulum
### Galgi Complex
### Cytoskeleton
## Plasma membrane
### Phsopholipids

The description markup is optiional. 

CNL parser will create the graph with nodes and the relation suggested in the commented block. In the preferences user may choose to show the label in the rendered graph. 

Preferences component may also include another option: Default Mode: MindMap | ConceptMap | TransitionMap | FunctionMap |

These modes also correspond to Difficulty mode: |Easy | Moderate | Advanced | Expert |
