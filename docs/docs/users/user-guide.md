# NodeBook User Guide

Welcome to NodeBook! This guide will help you get started with creating and managing knowledge graphs using Controlled Natural Language (CNL).

## Getting Started

### First Steps
1. **Log in** to your NodeBook account
2. **Set your difficulty level** in Preferences (we recommend starting with Easy)
3. **Create your first graph** or explore existing ones
4. **Start building** your knowledge structure

### Understanding the Interface

NodeBook has several key areas:

- **Graph View**: The main visualization of your knowledge graph
- **Node Cards**: Detailed information about each node
- **Forms**: Tools for creating and editing nodes, relations, and attributes
- **Preferences**: Settings for your account and difficulty level

## Creating Knowledge

### Adding Nodes

1. **Click** on the graph area where you want to add a node
2. **Fill in** the basic information:
   - Name: What you want to call this concept
   - Description: A detailed explanation
   - Role: The type of entity (Individual, Class, Process, or Function)
3. **Save** your node

### Adding Relations

Relations connect nodes to show how they relate to each other.

1. **Select** a node to open its card
2. **Click** "Add Relation" in the Node Neighborhood section
3. **Choose** the relation type (e.g., "is part of", "causes", "has property")
4. **Select** the target node
5. **Add details** like adverbs or quantifiers (if available at your difficulty level)
6. **Save** the relation

### Adding Attributes

Attributes describe properties of nodes.

1. **Select** a node to open its card
2. **Click** "Add Attribute" in the Node Neighborhood section
3. **Choose** the attribute type (e.g., "color", "size", "temperature")
4. **Enter** the value
5. **Add units** if applicable (e.g., "degrees Celsius")
6. **Save** the attribute

## Using CNL (Controlled Natural Language)

CNL allows you to express complex relationships in readable syntax.

### Basic CNL Syntax

- **Relations**: `<relation_name> target_node`
- **Attributes**: `has attribute_name: value`
- **Adverbs**: `++adverb++ <relation> target`
- **Quantifiers**: `some/all/many <relation> target`

### Examples

```
<is part of> heart
has color: red
++quickly++ <moves> blood
all <contains> oxygen
```

## Advanced Features

### Morphs (Advanced/Expert Levels)

Morphs allow you to create different versions of the same node for different contexts.

1. **Enable** morph management in your difficulty level
2. **Create** different morphs for different scenarios
3. **Switch** between morphs to see different perspectives
4. **Manage** relations and attributes per morph

### Transitions (Advanced/Expert Levels)

Transitions show how nodes change over time or in different states.

1. **Select** a source node
2. **Click** "Create Transition"
3. **Choose** the target node
4. **Define** the transition conditions
5. **Save** the transition

### CNL Editing (Advanced/Expert Levels)

At higher difficulty levels, you can edit CNL directly.

1. **Open** the CNL editor
2. **Write** or modify CNL syntax
3. **Save** your changes
4. **Parse** to validate the syntax

## Tips for Success

### Start Simple
- Begin with basic nodes and simple relations
- Focus on understanding the concepts before adding complexity
- Use the CNL view to see how your knowledge is structured

### Use Descriptions
- Write detailed descriptions for your nodes
- Use the parse button (when available) to extract relations and attributes
- Keep descriptions clear and informative

### Organize Your Knowledge
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Group related concepts together
- Use roles appropriately (Individual vs Class vs Process)

### Collaborate
- Share your graphs with others
- Seek help when you're stuck
- Learn from other users' approaches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**I can't see certain features**
- Check your difficulty level in Preferences
- Some features are only available at higher levels

**My graph looks messy**
- Use the layout options to reorganize
- Consider using different node types for better organization

**I'm not sure what role to use**
- **Individual**: Specific instances (e.g., "My heart")
- **Class**: Categories or types (e.g., "Heart")
- **Process**: Actions or events (e.g., "Blood circulation")
- **Function**: Operations or capabilities (e.g., "Pumping blood")

### Getting Help

- **Check** the difficulty levels guide
- **Use** the help system within NodeBook
- **Ask** questions in the collaboration area
- **Contact** the NodeBook team for technical support

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Explore** different difficulty levels
2. **Try** advanced features like morphs and transitions
3. **Experiment** with complex CNL syntax
4. **Share** your knowledge graphs with others
5. **Contribute** to collaborative knowledge building

Remember: NodeBook is designed to grow with you. Start simple and gradually explore more advanced features as you become more comfortable with the system.
