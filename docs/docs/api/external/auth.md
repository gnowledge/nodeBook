# User Registration/Authentication

This section documents the external authentication and user registration services that the NDF Studio system depends on.

## Overview

The NDF Studio system integrates with external authentication services for user management, including:

- User registration and account creation
- User authentication and login
- Password management and recovery
- Session management
- Role-based access control

## External Dependencies

### Authentication Providers
- **FastAPI Users**: Primary authentication framework
- **JWT Tokens**: For session management
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage

### Integration Points
- User registration endpoints
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset workflows
- User profile management

## Configuration

Authentication services are configured through environment variables and configuration files in the backend system.

## Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using secure algorithms
- JWT tokens have configurable expiration times
- Session management includes automatic cleanup
- Rate limiting is applied to authentication endpoints
