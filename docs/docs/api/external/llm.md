# LLM Endpoints

This section documents the Large Language Model (LLM) endpoints and services that the NDF Studio system depends on.

## Overview

The NDF Studio system integrates with LLM services for:

- Natural language generation and completion
- Code generation and assistance
- Content summarization and analysis
- Intelligent suggestions and recommendations
- Automated content creation

## External Dependencies

### LLM Services and APIs
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: Primary language model for text generation
- **Mistral AI**: Alternative language model for specific tasks
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Local model inference capabilities
- **Custom Fine-tuned Models**: Domain-specific language models

### Core LLM Functions
- **Text Generation**: Creating natural language content
- **Code Completion**: Assisting with code generation
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries
- **Question Answering**: Providing intelligent responses
- **Translation**: Multi-language support
- **Content Classification**: Categorizing and organizing content

## Integration Points

### LLM Service Integration
1. **API Configuration**: Setting up LLM service connections
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Designing effective prompts for specific tasks
3. **Response Processing**: Handling and validating LLM outputs
4. **Error Handling**: Managing API failures and rate limits
5. **Caching**: Optimizing performance with response caching

### Use Cases in NDF Studio
- **CNL Generation**: Creating controlled natural language from structured data
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatically generating documentation
- **Code Assistance**: Helping with development tasks
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzing and categorizing graph content
- **User Assistance**: Providing intelligent help and suggestions

## Configuration

LLM services are configured through:
- API key management
- Model selection and parameters
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Response caching strategies
- Fallback mechanisms for service failures

## Security and Privacy

- API keys are securely stored and managed
- User data is processed according to privacy policies
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and controls costs
- Response validation ensures quality and safety
