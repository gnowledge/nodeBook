# About NodeBook

NodeBook is more than a notebook. 

It is a peer-to-peer, knowledge graph authoring environment
based on the Neighborhood Description Framework (NDF). It allows users
to build and share complex knowledge graphs using a simple,
markdown-inspired Controlled Natural Language (CNL).

The architecture of the App is inspired by https://www.gnu/org/software/gnowsys. 

You can read more about it from https://docs.nodeBook.in.

It uses hypercore for storing data by default in an encrypted format:

NodeBook is free and open source software, licensed as AGPL v3. Source
