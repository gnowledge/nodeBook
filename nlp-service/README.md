# üß† NodeBook NLP Service

A microservice providing natural language processing capabilities for NodeBook, including text analysis, grammar parsing, and graph building suggestions.

## üöÄ Features

### Current (Phase 1)
- **English Grammar Analysis** using compromise library
- **Text Parsing** - Parts of speech, entities, relationships
- **Graph Suggestions** - Node, relation, and attribute recommendations
- **Learning Tips** - Educational guidance for better graph creation
- **Cost Analysis** - Always free with local processing

### Planned (Phase 2)
- **AI Model Integration** - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini
- **Multi-language Support** - Spanish, French, German, etc.
- **Advanced Parsing** - Dependency analysis, logical connectives
- **Cost Optimization** - Smart provider selection
