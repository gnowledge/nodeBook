# Transition (Declarative)

Transition shows prior-state of nodes and their state on one side, and
post-state of nodes on the other side; and prior state also includes
the conditions for the transition. Conditions are necessary and
sufficient conditions required for the transition to take place. they
could be more than one node. Similarly the post-state can also be more
than one node.

Since a polynode (polymmorphic node) is a node with more than one
possible morph, it is the same node that is changing, therefore, we
cannot give a new ids except the name change; e.g. oxygen becomes
oxide ion after gaining two more electrons.
